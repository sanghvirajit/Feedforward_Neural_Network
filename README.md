# Feedforward Neural Network from Scratch

A feedforward neural network is build from scartch by only using powerful python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

In this code four different weight initializations are implemented, Zeros, Xavier, He and Kumar.

Along with different weight initializations, four different optimizers are also implemented, Gadient Descent, RMSProp, Adam and Adamax.

Deep Learning framwork TensorFlow is used only to load the MNIST Dataset. The implemented code is then tested on the MNIST (Handwritten digits) Dataset.

Following are the final results obtained:
